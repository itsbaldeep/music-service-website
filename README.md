## Backstory

It was made in 3 hours total. I did follow some tutorials and references along with some prior knowledge of web development. All the description and headings of the websites is in French. At the time of making this website, I only know a little to no French, as a consequence there might be some mistakes. So I thought it's a nice way to practice both computer languages and human languages by making a website myself in French. It was quite fun, to be honest.
